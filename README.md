This is the official repo for our paper [Language Generation from Brain Recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09889). Language generation from brain recordings is a novel approach that supports direct language generation with BCIs (brain-computer interfaces) without pre-defineng or pre-generating language candidates to select from.


## Quick Start
We have provided an example dataset to facilitate the replication of experiments. To run the example dataset, you can go into the sub-directory *language_generation/src* and use the following command:

```bash
cd language_generation/src
# model training and evaluation (runing BrainLLM)
python main.py -task_name Pereira_example -cuda 0 -load_check_point False -model_name llama-7b -checkpoint_path example -batch_size 8 -lr 1e-4 -pos False -pretrain_lr 1e-3 -pretrain_epochs 10 -wandb none -mode all
# control evaluation (runing PerBrainLLM)
python main.py -task_name Pereira_example -cuda 0 -load_check_point False -model_name llama-7b -checkpoint_path example -batch_size 8 -lr 1e-4 -pos False -pretrain_lr 1e-3 -pretrain_epochs 10 -wandb none -input_method permutated -mode evaluate -output test_permutated
# control evaluation (runing LLM)
python main.py -task_name Pereira_example -cuda 0 -load_check_point False -model_name llama-7b -checkpoint_path example -batch_size 8 -lr 1e-4 -pos False -pretrain_lr 1e-3 -pretrain_epochs 10 -wandb none -input_method mask_input -mode evaluate -output test_nobrain
```

To run with [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html), you can also use the provided scripts in the sub-directory *language_generation/scripts* (remember to replace the name of conda environment and the path of the sub-directory *language_generation/scripts* according to your settings).

```bash
sh example.sh
```

To run with the datasets utilized in our paper, please download the dataset from [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/04e8cfe6c9c743c69f08/) and unzip it. Use the parameter *-dataset_path* to specify the path of your unzip dataset.
For example, if you unzip the dataset into your home directory as *~/released/*, then you can run the training and evaluation of BrainLLM and the participant 1 in Huth dataset using the following command:
```bash
python main.py -task_name Huth_1 -cuda 0 -load_check_point False -model_name llama-7b -checkpoint_path Huth_1 -batch_size 8 -lr 1e-4 -pos False -pretrain_lr 1e-3 -pretrain_epochs 10 -wandb none -mode all -dataset_path ../../dataset/ -pos True
``` 

To evaluate the model performance, you can refer to the code in *language_generation/src/post_hoc_evaluate.py*

## Full-text construction

In addition to the language completion task, our method also supports generating a complete piece of text based on brain signals spanning a few minutes. The relevant code can be found in the directory of *end2end_generation/*. 
The implementation of full story construction is based on [Tang et al.](https://github.com/HuthLab/semantic-decoding) (thanks for their code).
To run this code, you also need to download some helpful files from their code, i.e., the *data_lm* directory and transform the vocabulary of their implementation into the vocabulary of Llama-2 or GPT-2 series models.
Here is a example that generate the human semantics while they are perceiving story of "where there's smoke":

```bash
cd language_generation/src
# train BrainLLM with the spliting strategy that left out the story of "where there's smoke"
python main.py -task_name Huth_1 -cuda 0 -load_check_point False -model_name gpt2-xl -checkpoint_path Huth_1_gpt2-xl -batch_size 8 -lr 1e-4 -pos False -pretrain_lr 1e-3 -pretrain_epochs 0 -wandb none -mode all -dataset_path ../../dataset/ -pos True -data_spliting end2end
cd ../end2end_generation/src
# run inference for full story construction
python main.py -task_name Huth_1 -cuda 0 -load_check_point False -model_name gpt2-xl -checkpoint_path Huth_1_gpt2-xl -wandb none -mode evaluate -pos True -data_spliting end2end -mode end2end -use_bad_words_ids False -ncontext 10 -gcontext 10 -length_penalty 0.3 -beam_width 3 -extensions 3
# run evaluation with Huth's metrics
python evaluate.py -dir Huth_1
``` 

### Installation

This repo is developed with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). It can be installed manually according to the requirement of platform-specific custom configuration. The recommended commands for installation are:
```bash
# XX.X is a placeholder for cudatoolkit version. It should be specified according to your environment
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=XX.X -c pytorch 
```
In our experiment, we use torch verison 2.0.1 and cuda verison 11.7.
In addition to PyTorch, we adopt several publicly available packages, which can be installed by
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Llama-7b may produce NaNs during half-precision training. If you encounter this issue, you can refer to this: [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/25065](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/25065).

### Model Training
To train the model, you need to special the parameter *-mode* as *training* (only training) or *all* (training and evaluation).
You can specify several hyper parameters according to your requirement, the default parameters for Pereira's dataset, Huth's dataset, and Narratives dataset are provided in *language_generation/scripts/example.sh*, *language_generation/scripts/huth.sh*, and *language_generation/scripts/narratives.sh*, respectively.
The meaning of hyper parameters are listed below:

### Model Evaluation
To evaluate the model with different prompt input, i.e., BrainLLM, PerBrainLLM, and LLM, you can specify the parameter *-input_method* as *normal*, *permutated*, *without_brain*, respectively. To test the model performance without any text prompt, you should train and evaluate the model while setting *-input_method* as *without_text*.

After that, you can get output files for different prompt inputs. Then, you can evaluate their performance by runing the python script *language_generation/src/post_hoc_evaluatoion.py* with the path of output files specified.
Refer to *language_generation/src/post_hoc_evaluatoion.py* for example usage:
```bash
python language_generation/src/post_hoc_evaluatoion.py
```

### Dataset
We test our approach on three public fMRI datasets: [Pereira's dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03068-4), [Huth's dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02437-z), and [Narratives dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01033-3). The brief introduction, ethical information, statistics, and useage details of these datasets are provied in our paper.
A preprocessed verison dataset is released in [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/04e8cfe6c9c743c69f08/), where the sub-directory of *Pereira*, *Huth*, and *Narratives* contain the preprocessed data for each participant and story in Pereira's dataset, Huth's dataset, and Narratives dataset, respectively.
